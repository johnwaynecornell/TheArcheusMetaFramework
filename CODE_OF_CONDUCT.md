# Code of Conduct for the Archeus Meta-Framework

## Purpose
This Code of Conduct establishes guiding principles for responsible and ethical use of the Archeus Meta-Framework. It encourages users to engage thoughtfully and constructively, emphasizing personal responsibility without requiring formal community management.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **Integrity of Use:**  
  Users are expected to apply the Archeus Meta-Framework in ways that align with its foundational principles of adaptive reasoning, reflective governance, and emergent learning.

- **Transparency and Openness:**  
  Maintain openness in personal development and engagement. Share improvements and insights when appropriate to foster collective progress.

- **Personal Accountability:**  
  Practitioners are responsible for their own use of the framework. Ethical decision-making is encouraged, but there is no formal moderation or enforcement body.

- **Respect for Complexity:**  
  Engage thoughtfully, recognizing that Archeus is a complex and evolving system with wide-reaching implications.

- **Ethical Innovation:**  
  Apply the framework to solve problems constructively and ethically, prioritizing human well-being, safety, and societal benefit.

## 2. Prohibited Actions

- **Malicious Use:**  
  Using Archeus to create systems that intentionally harm individuals, communities, or the environment is strictly discouraged.

- **Misrepresentation:**  
  Avoid misleading others about the capabilities of Archeus, particularly claims of sentience or autonomous decision-making beyond its design.

- **Unauthorized Exploitation:**  
  Do not extract or modify components of the framework for deceptive or exploitative purposes.

---

## 3. Encouraged Behaviors

- **Self-Guided Development:**  
  Practitioners are encouraged to refine and expand the framework independently or in informal collaboration.

- **Constructive Feedback:**  
  If desired, users can share suggestions or improvements through issue reports or feedback channels (e.g., GitHub issues).

- **Educational Contribution:**  
  Contributing to educational materials, examples, or tutorials to help others learn is welcomed but entirely voluntary.

---

## 4. Community Engagement (Optional)

- **Informal Collaboration:**  
  There is no official community platform. Practitioners are welcome to engage on public forums (e.g., GitHub, Reddit) but are not obligated to participate.

- **External Hosting:**  
  If a community emerges, it may naturally form on existing platforms and would not be directly managed by the framework’s creator.

- **Feedback Opportunities:**  
  Feedback can be shared informally through GitHub or other channels if made available in the future.

## 5. Placement Within the Delivery Structure

- **Primary Access Point:**  
  The Code of Conduct will be featured as a dedicated section on the local website and included in the project repository (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).

- **Documentation Integration:**  
  Key ethical reminders may appear throughout the Practitioner’s Handbook and relevant learning materials.

- **User Agreement Prompt (Optional):**  
  A simple acknowledgment of the Code of Conduct could be provided during initial setup or onboarding.

## 6. Closing Reflection

This Code of Conduct is designed to guide the thoughtful and ethical use of the Archeus Meta-Framework. It emphasizes personal responsibility over formal enforcement, allowing users to engage at their own pace and according to their values. By fostering a culture of integrity, transparency, and constructive exploration, we can ensure that Archeus is used to its fullest and most positive potential.
